#### What can I offer?

There are two questions you should ask yourself when deciding whether
to offer something:

* Will others find it valuable?
* Is it legal?

If you answered "yes" to both questions, go ahead! If you didn't, try
to come up with something else.

#### How much does it cost?

Nothing! Everything is free.

#### Who is the site for?

The site is aimed at
[effective altruists](http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/)—people
who want to help others in the most effective ways possible.

#### How do I add formatting my offers and wanteds?

You can use
[Markdown](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet)
to add links, bulleted lists, and other formatting to your offers, wanteds, and profile.

#### How can I help?

Thanks for asking! There are several ways:

* **Post useful offers.** The site works only as long as people are
willing to contribute.
* **See if you can fulfill any wanteds.** You can be notified of new
  wanteds by [Twitter]("https://twitter.com/Skillshare_im") or
  [RSS](http://localhost:3000/proposals.atom).
* **Take people up on their offers.** Don't be shy about asking for
  stuff on the site—that's why people put it there!
* **Improve the site.** If you know Ruby on Rails or front-end web
  development and want to make the site better, grab the code
  [here](https://github.com/patbl/ea-skillshare) or
  [send us an e-mail](mailto:pbrinichlanglois@gmail.com).

#### What if I don't have anything to offer?

Everybody has something! But if you don't, you're still welcome to use
the site.

#### Why not buy and sell goods and services through oridinary markets?

That's a great option for a lot of things. If you need nourishment,
visit the supermarket; if you need medical care, see your doctor. But there are several reasons
you might consider Skillshare.im instead:

* **Friends.** You're more likely to build relationships with people
  you meet on Skillshare.im than with people you have private
  transactions with.
* **Non-market goods.** Certain things, like career advice or study
  buddies, are hard to buy. Skillshare.im helps you connect with
  people who offer these things.
* **Flexibility.** While in theory you could work longer hours and
  donate the extra money to charity, this often isn't possible. Many
  people have salaries, or work on schedules set by their employers.
  Offering your skills for free to other altruists lets you continue
  doing good after hours.
* **Tax savings.** If you sell your services, some of that money will go to
  taxes. If you donate the money you earn, you may decrease the amount
  you owe in taxes, but usually you still pay something.
* **Community.** By participating in Skillshare.im, you're helping the
  effective-altruism movement grow.

#### Why isn't my profile picture showing?

If you didn't sign in with Facebook, you'll need use Gravatar to display a profile picture. Go to [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com), create an account (using the same e-mail address you used on Skillshare.im), and upload your picture there.

#### I have a suggestion for the site.

Great! [Let us know](mailto:pbrinichlanglois@gmail.com).

#### How can I sound more like Shakira when I sing?

Spanish accent and make everything you say sound really cool and funky ([source](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091122120932AAuIAg5)).
