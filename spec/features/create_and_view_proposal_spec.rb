So I was tired of spending so much time preparing and consuming 
food, so I tried going on an **allâ€“dog-food diet** for a couple of
months. It wasn't so bad, but I think my dog noticed. She
stopped listening to me.

<b>Plus</b>, I'd always finish eating before my girlfriend did, but
she'd want me to stay there so she could talk about her
co-workers or whatever. So I was like, what's the point? But I 
thought somebody else might be interested in giving it a go.
It's _one-hundred percent_ vegan, and pretty tasty, too.
